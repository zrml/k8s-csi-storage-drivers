# Longhorn

[Longhorn.io](https://longhorn.io/)

We found Longhorn very easy to install and use.
We used it for demos, POCs and tranining with K3s within a [Canonical multipass](https://multipass.run/) solution and its behaviour is consistent.
It comes with a nice web-UI that makes things easy to understand & use.

We have not tested it from a performance POV.
