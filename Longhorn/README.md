# Longhorn

[Longhorn.io](https://longhorn.io/)

We found Longhorn very easy to install and use.
We used it for demos, POCs and tranining with K3s within a [Canonical multipass](https://multipass.run/) solution and its behaviour is consistent.
It comes with a nice web-UI that makes things easy to understand & use.

Performance is tied to the storage subsystem used. In our case we used AWS gp3 with cross AZ distribution for resiliency and the performance wasn't great.
Also some features that we wanted ASAP were not available not schedulable to be put on a roadmap as it fundamanentally is an open source project.
